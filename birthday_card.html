                 Thanks for being the incredibly epic person you are. I will try to keep it short so that you don’t have to spread reading this on your planner.<br> <br>
This year was unexpected from its beginning to its end and an opportunity to see you grow in so many ways. From learning that you learned how to use a drill, to seeing you learn  how to communicate your feelings and emotions, to watching you go grocery shopping. Just watching you face every challenge was an opportunity to see how strong, vulnerable and willing of a person you are, and how great of a men you are. I am sure your dad would be so proud of you. <br><br>
I wish you the best of birthdays, because the person who has taught me to be more patient, forgiving and understanding, deserves it. I hope God gives you wisdom and strength to face every new challenge that comes from being 20. I love you so much and I hope that you get to celebrate 100s of more birthdays. You have make quite the impact on my life and I am glad to say that even though I don’t cry over people I would cry if you left my life, because you make me a better person and I will forever be thankful for that.</p>
